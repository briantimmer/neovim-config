# Neovim config

Based on Lazy.vim, and not actually up-to-date with how I'm using Neovim locally -- that is, as a barebones config from within vscode. Maybe in the future I'll switch back to full Neovim and rekindle this config.

## Tips
- When neo-tree opens a file they display as tabs. Moving between them in Normal mode is as simple as hitting `H` and `L`
